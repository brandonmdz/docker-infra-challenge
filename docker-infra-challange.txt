Docker Infrastructure Challange

Your task is to create an infrastructure with docker compose help that able to support the system in such configuration:

1. MySQL database server (8x)
2. PHP-FPM (8.1)
3. NGINX
4. Varnish Cache
5. Redis
6. ElasticSearch instance
7. RabbitMQ instance

7. Prometheus
8. Alert Manager
9. Grafana dashboard
10-.. . Prometheus exporters for mysql, php-fpm, varnihs, nginx, redis, elastic


You should be able to run magento 2.4.x instance using this infrastructure. You should configure performance statistics aggregation with Prometheus help. You need to collect performance characreristics for: mysql database, php-fpm, nginx, redis, elastic, varnish. You need to preconfigure grafana with dashboards for listed services.

Instance parameters: domain name to serve, grafana dashboard access (external) port. 

Prometheus data, mysql database, files, elastic instance data should survive instance recreation (e.g. docker compose down && docker compose up -d).

You need to configure Alerts when: 
1. One of the monitored service is went down.
2. No free php-fpm workers available
3. MySQL server has too high slow query rate (more than 3/minute, for example)
4. Elastic Search instance health is "Red"
